#Exercise Description:
#Create a program that stores personal information in variables — such as first name, last name, age, birth year, and height. Then, print all this information on the screen. The program should also calculate whether the person is an adult (age ≥ 18).

first_name = "Uriel"
last_name = "Silva"
age = 20
birth_year = 2000
is_adult = age >= 18
height_meters = 1.70

print("First name:", first_name)
print("Last name:", last_name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Birth year:", birth_year)
print("Is an adult?", is_adult)
print("Height in meters:", height_meters)
