**Python Learning Journey**

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! 🐍
This repository contains all the exercises, challenges, and small scripts I’ve completed while learning Python. Each file includes:

✔ A clear description of the original task

✔ Clean and readable code

✔ Variables, comments, and messages in English

✔ Simple logic that reflects my genuine learning process

✔ Progressive difficulty as I move forward

The goal of this repository is to document my evolution as a developer while building a strong foundation in Python.

**🚀 About This Repository**

Here you'll find:

🔸 Basic syntax exercises

🔸 Input/output practice

🔸 Conditionals

🔸 String manipulation

🔸 Calculations (IMC/BMI, comparisons, etc.)

🔸 Error handling with try/except

🔸 And more as the journey continues...

Each script is written in a straightforward way—exactly how I would code it during my learning process.
